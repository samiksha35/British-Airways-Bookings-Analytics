* British Airways Booking Analytics (Python + SQL + Power BI)
An end-to-end data analytics project to explore and visualize booking behaviors for British Airways flights.  
This project uncovers shocking cancellation trends, top routes, and full-service usage with Python, SQL & Power BI.

* Project Overview
This project analyzes airline bookings to extract business insights across routes, travel timing, and passenger preferences. We cleaned real-world-like booking data in Python, wrote SQL to extract insights, and visualized everything with a glassmorphism-inspired Power BI dashboard.

* Tech Stack
 1 Python: Data cleaning, transformation
 2 SQL: Extracting key business insights
 3 Power BI: Dashboard design and storytelling
           

* Key Insights (with Visuals)

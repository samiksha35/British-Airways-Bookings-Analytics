Passengers most frequently fly to Sydney, Perth, and Taipei.

Business Takeaway:
These cities attract the highest incoming flight traffic.
Airlines should increase seat availability, offer premium services, and launch bundled travel deals to boost revenue on these routes

---

#Insight 2: **Top Origins of Travel**

https://github.com/samiksha35/British-Airways-Bookings-Analytics/blob/main/Insight_2.png 

Most trips originated from Bangkok, Seoul, and Melbourne.

Business Takeaway:
These are high-frequency departure cities.
Airlines can optimize scheduling, deploy larger aircraft, and streamline ground operations to minimize delays and handle volume more efficiently.

#Insight 3: **Weekend vs Weekday Booking Trends**

https://github.com/samiksha35/British-Airways-Bookings-Analytics/blob/main/Insight_3.png  

Only 24.7% of bookings happen on weekends.

Business Takeaway:
Airlines should launch weekend-only discounts, leisure packages, or event-based promotions to fill seats and increase weekend revenue.

---

#Insight 4: **Most Popular Flight Routes**

https://github.com/samiksha35/British-Airways-Bookings-Analytics/blob/main/Insight_4.png  

Top routes include ICN → SYD, AKL → KUL, and MEL → SGN.

Business Takeaway:
Airlines can add more flights, apply dynamic pricing, or introduce route-specific loyalty programs to drive engagement and increase margins.

---

#Insight 5: **Weekend Routes with Zero Confirmations**

https://github.com/samiksha35/British-Airways-Bookings-Analytics/blob/main/Insight_5.png  

Some weekend routes had 100% unconfirmed bookings.

Business Takeaway:
Airlines should test flexible cancellation offers, group travel bundles, or price drops to convert weekend browsers into bookers

---

#Insight 6: **Cities with High Full-Service Uptake**

https://github.com/samiksha35/British-Airways-Bookings-Analytics/blob/main/Insight_6.png 

Passengers from Visakhapatnam, Sydney, and Melbourne often opt for full-service.

Business Takeaway 6:  
These cities show strong demand for premium services. Airlines can increase revenue through targeted upselling (bundled services, luxury upgrades) or loyalty rewards at these destinations.

#Power BI Dashboard Sneak Peek

https://github.com/samiksha35/British-Airways-Bookings-Analytics/blob/main/final%20airport%20dashboard.png

The dashboards reveal high booking activity from Australia and Asia, but a low confirmation rate overall. Most travelers book well in advance, prefer night flights, and travel early in the week. One-way trips show even lower conversions—highlighting the need for flexible offers and dynamic pricing.

* Workflow Summary

1. **Python:** Cleaned messy data (missing values, case mapping, encoded weekend flights)
2. **SQL:** Wrote 6 queries to uncover key patterns & behaviors
3. **Power BI:** Visualized all insights with slicers, KPI cards, donut & bar charts

---

* Real-World Business Impact
>  **85% of bookings were cancelled**  
This major insight could lead to:
- Policy review for cancellation/refunds
- UX improvements to booking flow
- New strategy around demand forecasting
